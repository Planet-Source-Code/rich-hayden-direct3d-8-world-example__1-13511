### Description

Thanks for downloading my code. This is really just an example of how to begin a world in Direct3D 8. The graphics aren't very good, but I hope that it maybe helps someone. It's pretty well commented and I think it's quite easy to understand. If you have any questions/queries, I'll endeavour to answer them. Please provide feedback and please vote.

I wasn't going to post this yet, but I need some help to finish/make it better. I am stuck on how to do collision detection and also how to make colours in a texture transparent. If anyone can help with either of these problems, I'd be very grateful. You can either provide your response in the form of feedback, or drop me a line at r_hayden@breathemail.net.

Hopefully, then I can release a complete D3D 8 world.

Thanks for your time.

Special thanks must go to Simon Price (http://www.vbgames.co.uk) for his excellent D3D tutorials and the help which he gave me on some of this project.
